@brief      SD RAW library header.
@details	This library supports MMC, SD1, SD2, and SDHC/SDXC type cards.
			By defining SD_BUFFER, the library also implements a 512 byte buffer
			for reading and writing.

@todo 		Support for AVR and SAMX AVR without using the Arduino SPI library.
@todo 		Support for using Software SPI (bit banging).
@todo 		Use CMD6 during initialization to switch card to high speed mode if
			it supports it. This will be helpful for the due since the SPI
			speed can be up to 84MHz.
@todo 		Allow setting CS high when card is in busy state for operations
			instead of waiting. However, if an error is thrown for the
			operation, the host will get that error on the next command it
			sends.
@todo 		Send_status should be sent after all busy signals
			(look at ch 4.3.7).
@todo 		Send stop_transmission if there was an error during
			write continuous (and read continuous??).
@todo 		Get the number of well written blocks for sequential writing just in
			case if there was an error.
@todo 		Card reads take up to 100ms and writes take up to 500ms. Make
			timeouts reflect this.
@todo 		Reduce the number of error codes.
