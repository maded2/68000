WARNING:NgdBuild:1440 - User specified non-default attribute value (2.5) was
   detected for the CLKIN1_PERIOD attribute on PLL
   "u_ddr3_mig/memc3_infrastructure_inst/u_pll_adv".  This does not match the
   PERIOD constraint value (3.07692308 ns.).  The uncertainty calculation will
   use the PERIOD constraint value.  This could result in incorrect uncertainty
   calculated for PLL output clocks.
